## Summary

###Drawback

One drawback of this web application, is the fact that its source of information is limited.

###Recomendations

Creating a web application that can scrape recent data would provide an up-to-date information in this subject. Another recommendation is the use of a dropdown list where the user can visualize the options available and narrow down the output for an improved experience.
